This is to summarise the problems and their approach in short :

*Duplicate : no loop. try to add in collection of unique element(set), returns true/false
*Anagram : sorting makes it nLogn, not preferred; loop makes it On. Rather,
     try to increment/add to those letter already present and then try to remove them for the 2nd word.
*Two sum: try to add elements as key to map, works in 1 loop. but, before adding check if the (target-this number) exists or not. 
          if exists then return, otherwise just add to map.
*Palindrome : transform. check from middle/ends to middle , but not optimal.
            use 2 pointer -left/right comes toards center while checks if they are equal or not.
*PlusOne  : for traverse from last such that, if it's 9 ,increment , check again if its 10 , make it 0 ,
                otherwise return instantly, for 1st to be 9, or all 9s, return new array of first 1, others 0.

** Group Anagram : Indexing required , use map for key. check key to add values as a list or add another
                    key with value as list : List<String> 

*Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array : compare adjacent elements , replace if not equal.
*Climbing Stairs : kind of permutation  , combination type. for n=5 : 4! +5 
*LongestCommonPrefix : vertical scanning(bruteforce), horz scanning(O(n*m)),O(1)
**Two Sum(sorted array) : use 2 pointer with check length(<3). not use set, map because it takes more loops.


commit day is considered , push any day doesn't matter.






strategy : 1 easy , 1 med.




will be adding notes soon for java , for interview and learning
