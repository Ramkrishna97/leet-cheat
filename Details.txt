This is to summarise the problems and their approach in short :

*Duplicate : no loop. try to add in collection of unique element(set), returns true/false
*Anagram : sorting makes it nLogn, not preferred; loop makes it On. Rather,
     try to increment/add to those letter already present and then try to remove them for the 2nd word.
*Two sum: try to add elements as key to map, works in 1 loop. but, before adding check if the (target-this number) exists or not. if exists then return, otherwise just add to map.
*Palindrome : transform. check from middle/ends to middle , but not optimal.
            use 2 pointer -left/right comes toards center while checks if they are equal or not.
