This is to summarise the problems and their approach in short :
Duplicate : no loop. try to add in collection of unique element(set), returns true/false
Anagram : sorting makes it nLogn, not preferred; loop makes it On. Rather,
     try to increment/add to those letter already present and then try to remove them for the 2nd word.
